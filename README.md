# Overview

An [RTLIL](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/kernel/rtlil.h)
frontend that includes a lexer and parser auto-generated by
[LALRPOP](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop).

Most of this code was originally authored by 
[XHE](https://github.com/xhebox/rtlil-rs).

It has been re-factored to support more portable custom visitor
enter and exit methods that might be more appropriate for a re-usable
RTLIL frontend.

Currently, one visitor implementation is provided, namely, dumper, which takes an RTLIL ast and converts it back into valid RTLIL text.

``bin/parse.rs`` consumes an RTLIL file, generates an AST, and the uses
dumper to generate RTLIL text again, which could be written to a file.

# Using
To run ``bin/parse``, do the following:
``cargo run examples/alu.rtlil``

# TODO
 - [ ] Make dumper return string
